There was Guilf, a rugged bard with a quick wit; Miraak, an outcast dragonborn soldier; Kethra a young sorcerer with a mysterious past; Fuko a drow wizard from the Ghost Domain; and Dolman, a brave dwarven scout eager to prove himself. As they chatted, they heard of a large-scale attack of golden dragons in the south, causing widespread panic and chaos. The city of Watheton had no choice but to organise a mass evacuation to the nearby Tolfoddund mines. The group quickly offered to assist the Watheton leaders in ensuring safe passage for the inhabitants of the city. They scouted the road to the mines, fending off attacks from dangers along the way. Upon reaching the mines, the group discovered that their journey was far from over. A former friend of Guilf, Nilperto, had been turned into an undead creature, with a strange tattoo on his neck. The group fought bravely against Nilperto and his minions, eventually defeating them and uncovering a hidden passage that led to the Intermine and further to the Nargun Mines. 1.2 Chapter 2 The Glasrath alliance As the group emerged from the Intermine, they found themselves on the outskirts of the Nargun stronghold. The dwarves, who had been battling undead attackers for years, welcomed them with open arms. Over the next few weeks, many other people came to the mines seeking protection. Populations and armies from the cities to the south of Watheton, as well as drows from the Ghost Domain, arrived seeking shelter. Some of the refugees from the cities had actually seen the dragons, offering a varied description of their appearance and abilities. Some said they had never seen anything like them before, while others claimed they had fought dragons in the past, but never ones as these. As tensions rose, the leaders of the various groups appointed the group of five as their representatives. They were tasked with forming an alliance amongst all the armies in order to stand a chance against the approaching horde of undead. In the midst of this chaos, the group met Ghuse, a martial cleric from Algath, the goddess of life and death. As they worked to unite the disparate forces, the group learned more about the strange tattoo on Nilperto’s neck. They discovered that it was a mark of the undead army, a sign of their allegiance to a powerful necromancer who was rumoured to be behind the attacks. With the clock ticking down and the undead army approaching, the group worked tirelessly to coordinate the defences of the mines. They organised the various armies into a cohesive unit, using their unique skills and talents to prepare and equip them for battle. They knew that the battle ahead would be brutal and bloody, but they also knew that they had a chance to turn the tide and protect the innocent people under their care. 1.3 Chapter 3 Battle from Ammuinoth The Glasrath Alliance now faces a horde of undead marching from the Ammuinoth. The battle starts, and three clashes happen in the mines. Miraak is killed, but was lucky enough to be close to Ghuse who starts a long ritual to resurrect him. Fuko also falls in battle, but she is unlucky to sink in the lake, only to be found too late. In the end, the alliance is victorious, but not without many casualties - including the wyrmling gold dragon that was freed by the Glasrath Defenders (the name given to Miraak, Guilf, Kethra, Dolman, and the now deceased Fuko). Access to the city of Khatdzig is established again. The group is celebrated as heroes, and their names are forever etched in the history of these mines. They have faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious, proving that even in the darkest of times, there is still hope.

With the goal of investigating the disappearance of the Gaelire Beikae, the Shield of Beauty, and her Paragon Force - which supposedly came to the Holzander burnt castle 10 years ago - the Glasrath Defenders went into the Ammuinoth. In the Castle of Bells they’ve met Weldon, a very pleasant werebear and then, in the Ardismouth Temple, they fought Tekerluth (who told them she was pregnant from Miraak). Due to combat injuries they decided to look for an exit towards the desert again. The Defenders reached Mystra’s temple in the north desert, where they learned of other forces in play. One of them is a strange and powerful power within the Holzander castle. A second one is the religious and military organisation known as the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA), which burned the Holzander castle 110 years ago, and apparently have some influence on the cities on the surface in the region. 2.2 Chapter 5 A breath from the desert 3877.5A, summer The Glasrath Defenders marched through the desolate landscape of Ammuinoth, their path illuminated only by the dim light of the Ghost Domain. As they approached the Holzander castle, they encountered a Ghost Rider, a cursed creature never before seen in the mortal. The Defenders clashed with the beast, their weapons and spells piercing its ethereal form. After a brief rest to recover from their wounds, the group pressed on towards the castle. The sight that greeted them was one of destruction and decay. The walls had crumbled and the once-proud turrets were mere ruins. Strange feathery creatures seem to have taken lair in the broken battlements, but none were there while the Defenders entered. As they searched for a way inside, they discovered a hole in the underkeep that led to the castle’s subterranean depths. The group cautiously descended the rickety wooden staircase, the air thick with the stench of bird droppings and decay. At the bottom of the stairs, they stood at the entrance to a dimly-lit chamber. With weapons at the ready, they stepped forward into the unknown, prepared to face whatever terrors awaited them in the depths of the ruined castle. 2.3 Chapter 6 The torturer of Holzander 3877.5B, summer The Glasrath Defenders entered the first level of Holzander’s castle, and saw psychotic scenes of torture and death. They met the responsible for them - a torturer known as the Gaoler - who threw in disturbing comments about having tortured Gaelira and killed the Paragon Force. The defenders decided it was too much of it and went on to kill the Gaoler - who had support from animated torture equipment and zombies. The battle that followed was challenging and some of the defenders were significantly hit. Especially Miraak who, during combat, realised he was not really brought back to life by Ghuse, but has been reanimated as an intelligent undead. After killing the Gaoler, the defenders continued exploring the rooms and found two prisoners and their detainer, an ogre called Scar. The prisoners were Dugan Lovay - a dust elf merchant from the Linhe cities -, her companion, the Red Heart, and a halfling scholar from the capital Throta (in the northwest), who has been researching a disease known as the Lady Scurvy. The disease is some kind of death lycanthropy, but with very different consequences, that started afflicting the region about a year ago. Scar, the ogre, did not pose a threat to the defenders, and was very relieved that the Gaoler was finally dead. While talking with the prisoners, the group became aware of a magic Mystra’s door, through the catacombs, that goes into the surface (probably the lost access to the castle), and that the Gaoler knew the password to open it. Amyria also knows that this password is available in a book in Mystra’s temple’s library. In this first level, several monuments existed: a frog statue of a long lost deity, a bowman statue, representing Cauchurn in the death river, and a memorial to the first Holzander, who established the castle, and explored the Brezal Paths that are so rich in the area. The group then decided to venture towards the catacombs, where they met Ushulx, a cultist of Cauchurn. Ushulx partnered with them while they fought shadows coming from the catacombs to the east and south. Everyone was too hurt to continue after, and the party decided to rest in the cells, together with the prisoners and Ushulx, while Scar kept a look for them. 2.4 Chapter 7 The Void claim 3877.5B, summer After a much-needed rest, the defenders huddled together in a dimly lit cell, sharing their knowledge and plans. Amidst the whispers, Ushulx, Durgan, Red Hart, and Ichbon discussed the animosity between Algath and Charon, two deities from the Deadecho. They also revealed the presence of other formidable residents in the castle, such as Cagoth-ze, a master of time magic, Danaska, an expert in oozes, and the powerful beings Imortra and Gellert. Ushulx expressed her eagerness to locate Avrindt, the Creep, a red dragon rumoured to have transformed into a death dragon. Meanwhile, Ichbon shared his quest to find a long-lost elven library that may hold knowledge about the Lady Scurvy disease. The party engaged in a spirited debate about their next move, eventually deciding to venture to the lower level in search of Cagoth-ze. As they explored the second level, they stumbled upon records detailing gruesome ooze experiments and encountered a dangerous trap in the form of a green ink-ooze. Just moments later, Amirya’s sharp eyes spotted something extraordinary—a time tributary, a river of time flowing through one of the rooms. In a bold and impulsive act, Guilf stepped forward and crossed the tributary, only to fall unconscious and undergo a magical transformation, becoming significantly younger. It became apparent that Guilf had been claimed by The Void, bound to a contract with this mysterious entity. As the party deliberated their next steps, they noticed a clockwork servant skulking around the rooms, raising concerns about their safety. Acting swiftly, the group retreated from the second level and sought refuge in the safety of the cells on the first level, strategising their approach and considering the implications of Guilf’s newfound contract with The Void. 2.5 Chapter 8 First sight of Lady Scurvy 3877.5B3, summer With their strength waning and their wounds still fresh, the band of weary heroes embarked on a treacherous journey towards the revered temple of Mystra, their priorities aligned with rejuvenation and restoration. As they traversed the Ammuinoth, their footsteps weighed heavily while caring their wounded. It was during this perilous expedition that their eyes fell upon a grotesque sight—a creature, contorted and abominable, crawling with malevolence along the ceiling. Ichbon recognised the fiendish being as an unfortunate victim infected by the accursed Lady Scurvy disease. Miraak, ever vigilant, discerned disturbing similarities between the creature’s combat tactics and the vile vampire spawns employed by the armies of D’Elsin during the savage southern war. A battle ensued, arduous and fraught with peril, but it culminated in a final, decisive blow dealt by Kethra. Days later, they reached the temple and met an old acquaintance of Amyria’s, Jandar from the Desolate Flats, who informed them of undead ravaging Linhe. The FFKA, stalwart guardians of this strategic territory, had valiantly stood against the encroaching darkness. He was astonished as he discovered that the presumed fallen Glasrath Defenders still clung to life, offering their aid to the beleaguered region. Rested, they headed to Gimorkoc, facing a rare thunderstorm. The storm, as abruptly as it had materialised, eventually receded. A Rurkinar ritual, an esoteric ceremony seldom witnessed, was poised to commence, orchestrated by the cultists’ enigmatic high shaman. Their aim? To establish communion with the Angel Hound, a being of enigmatic power and purpose. Yet, amidst the gathering darkness and whispered incantations, Guilf, beset by a profound sense of disquiet, caught sight of a face within the throng—a visage hauntingly familiar, the countenance of his long-lost mother. Driven by an irresistible force, he chased after her, his companions hot on his heels. 2.6 Chapter 9 The Rurkinar ritual 3877.5F6, summer The valiant champions pursued Guilf’s enigmatic mother. Yet, as they delved deeper into the unfathomable abyss of her powers, their fortitude waned, and their resolute spirits trembled. Guilf’s mother possessed an indomitable mastery of Theurgy, a formidable force that unleashed abominations that sent shivers crawling along their spines, freezing their very souls. Reluctantly, the group retraced their steps to the central square, drenched in a torrential downpour and an ethereal glow emanating from the ancient temple stones. The ritual to commune with the dreaded Angel Hound was underway. The air grew thick with anticipation as the incantations surged and chaos erupted, a violent upheaval that seized the cultists with ferocious might, wrenching them away to the somber castle ward under the merciless grip of the FFKA. Undeterred by the dark turn of events, the heroes, cloaked in the veils of night, ventured into the shadowed heart of the castle ward. It was Guilf, his heart filled with courage and empathy, who dared to breach the psychic barriers of the Rurkinar Shaman. The long-awaited culmination of the ritual revealed the prison that ensnared the Angel Hound - the enigmatic Holzander Castle. The Shaman’s arduous work had reached its fateful conclusion. With the dawning of the morrow came the arrival of General Sergarus—a figurehead both dreaded and revered in Linhe. It was Sergarus who extended his impenetrable hand, granting clemency to the cultists detained in the night’s embrace, save for the Shaman. In a damning judgment of treason, the Shaman was sentenced to the ghastly fate of impalement. Two hours later, under the watchful gaze of the village, the order was carried out by an FFKA knight with merciless precision. 2.7 Chapter 10 Desert road 3877.6A6, autumn The party became aware that the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch (FFKA) marked them as a group consisting of two adults, two children, and one old brute - an unconventional combination that added an air of mystery to their reputation. As the heroes delved deeper into the mysteries of the land, they discovered that the thunderstorms in the region of Linhe had grown increasingly frequent and perilous. Prayers to Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle god, had fallen upon deaf ears, leaving the land vulnerable to the raging storms that now wreaked havoc upon the countryside. This disquieting revelation hinted at a growing imbalance in the forces that governed the realm. Undeterred by these challenges, the group forged ahead, deciding to make their way towards Eyaram, where they would assess their options for reaching the Holzander castle from the desert. However, their plans took an unexpected turn when a scout arrived from the east, bearing troubling news. Another horde of undead had launched an attack on the countryside, specifically targeting the lands east of Eyaram. A detachment of the FFKA was dispatched to gather more information, while their commander, Sergarus, remained stationed in Gimorkoc. The journey towards Eyaram commenced, and for the first two days, the group’s path remained uneventful, save for the peculiar sight of ancient organic structures that hinted at a forgotten past predating recorded history. On the third day, they found themselves navigating a treacherous gorge, realising that descending into its depths would render them vulnerable to unseen dangers. Opting for a safer route around the cliff, fate interceded in the form of a solitary figure - a protector of the road and an outcast of the Nurderad dragonborn known as Gulthas Morseth. Gulthas bore a burdened past, having been a participant in the raid of the mines under the influence of the battlemage Grezar. Near death’s door, Gulthas uncovered the true nature of his tormentor - a shadow dragon in disguise. The revelation struck a chord with Amyria, who recognised the description of the shadow dragon from ancient lore. These creatures had long dwelled deep within the Earth, slumbering for ages. They had departed from the material world, received by Algath’s blessings, only to return with nefarious intentions. Parting ways with Gulthas, the group continued their journey towards the ruined Temple of Remains. There, they engaged in skirmishes with weakened undead adversaries, their collective strength proving superior in combat. Kethra’s devastating power nearly laid waste to the entire ruin, but amid the chaos, a discovery awaited them—a tight, cold, and ominously glowing dark red tunnel that seemed to descend into the depths, perhaps leading to the enigmatic Ophaire. Amyria, channeling the divine might of her goddess Mystra, unleashed a wave of holy energy that obliterated seven undead creatures with a mere sight. The potency of her connection to Mystra became evident, further solidifying her status as a beacon of divine power within the group. As they navigated the Temple of Remains, they unraveled its past purpose - a prison once held captive Algath, the goddess of death herself. The remnants of the ancient power that had resided within its walls left a haunting imprint, a reminder of the forces that once shaped the land. With caution and wisdom, the party decided to explore other areas of the ruined temple, aware that each step took them deeper into the heart of darkness that permeated the land. Uncertainty loomed over them, but their resilience and determination remained unwavering as they braced themselves for the secrets yet to be unveiled within the Temple of Remains. 2.8 Chapter 11 Aivridyt’s past 3877.6B4, autumn In the grim depths of the Temple of Remains, the group of broken heroes came to a startling realisation - the tumultuous skirmish they had ignited upon their arrival had awoken other malevolent entities that lurked within the ancient halls dedicated to the death goddess. No sooner had the group taken a defensive stance than they found themselves cornered by two Blessed Dead Adepts, abominations that wielded an unholy mastery over the forces of death. These dark necromancers were accompanied by their grotesque minions, the slave husks—twisted, pitiful figures bound to their malevolent will. The direst of all was the zombie clot, a monstrous amalgamation of hundreds of decaying bodies, writhing and pulsating with an insatiable hunger for flesh. Desperation filled the air as the group fought fiercely against their relentless adversaries. In the midst of the chaotic battle, Kethra, once again facing the clutches of death, found herself almost consumed by the ravenous corpses. Salvation came in the form of Guilf, whose quick thinking conjured a shroud of magical darkness, enveloping the battlefield and granting Kethra a slim chance of escape. The following day, they took a moment to gather themselves and explored the remaining recesses of the ruined temple. Amidst the hundreds of tombs that lined the halls, their eyes fell upon four imposing statues and a tome written in the ancient draconic script. Two of the statues bore a chilling familiarity - Ghuse and Grezar, names that resonated with historical significance. However, the inscriptions on the statues hinted at a disquieting revelation - the beings masquerading as Ghuse and Grezar were mere facades, vessels assumed by none other than Aivridyt herself, carrying out her sinister machinations. The depths of her treachery were only beginning to reveal themselves. Leaving the temple behind, the group continued their arduous journey along the desert road. Soon, they encountered a sight both awe-inspiring and foreboding: a towering, ancient metal statue. Filled with a childlike curiosity, Guilf, unable to resist its allure, decided to perch within the statue’s mouth, immediately succumbing to a reverie that transcended mortal understanding. He found himself in communion with Mondendovil, the Ngar’tho Void - an ancient deity of the depths. Mondendovil spoke of the colossal statue as his long-lost physical form, and conveyed a chilling prophecy - the time for his return drew near. His devoted servants would soon arrive to reconnect his powerful mind with his formidable body, a union that would reshape the very fabric of existence. The implications of this encounter sent shivers coursing through the group’s spines, stirring a profound urgency within their hearts. Reluctantly leaving the enigmatic statue behind, the group pressed on, their sense of purpose heightened. The road led them to the Dwarf enclave of Durnum, where they sought respite and replenishment, even as the weight of their impending destiny hung heavily upon their shoulders. 2.9 Dramatis Personae: Aivridyt, the Creep Also known as: The Purple Evil, Ghuse, Grezar and other names In the shadowed annals of time, Aivridyt, once a small and ferocious female red dragon known as the Creep, ruled with a malevolence that sent shivers coursing through the Naragzah mountains. This fearsome creature, driven by a sinister curiosity, delved ever deeper into the labyrinthine caverns that lay beneath, venturing into the sacred mines of the two dwarven clans that called those depths their domain. The encounters with the Creep became a recurring nightmare for the Tolfoddund and Nargun warriors, who suffered greatly at her wrathful claws. It was in the year 3856 NC, amidst the blood-soaked peaks of the mountains, that an alliance was forged between the battered clans. United, they struck a grievous blow, leaving Aivridyt wounded and retreating into the dark recesses below. Humbled and wounded, the Creep sought solace in the unfathomable depths of the Ghost Domain. For six long years, she slumbered, her formidable essence cocooned in the embrace of darkness. Unbeknownst to her, during her deep slumber, a passage opened, beckoning her to the eerie realm known as the Dead Echo. Aivridyt was ensnared by its tendrils, and when she awoke, her once-vibrant scales had transmuted into a twisted shadow red, its hues akin to that of viscous petroleum, intertwined with accents of haunting purple. The Creep had become the Purple Evil—a creature steeped in darkness and corruption. To her dismay, the Purple Evil discovered that she had come to bear eggs, a phenomenon unheard of in the annals of draconic lore for millennia. Her progeny’s arrival was an unexpected twist of fate, and she laid the eggs in a cavernous lair, inadvertently attracting the attention of a destitute family dwelling perilously close to the mountains. Swift and merciless, the Purple Evil dispatched the parents, but she saw potential in the seven-year-old child, Kethra Stormwind. Cunningly, she donned the guise of a gentle sage, veiling her true nature beneath a veneer of wisdom and compassion. Kethra was ensnared in a perpetual state of drowsiness, ensorcelled by the Purple Evil’s potent magic and elixirs, deceived into believing she was raised by the sage in her humble abode. The Purple Evil harboured no clear plans for the child, and her careless machinations led to an unforeseen turn of events. Kethra, awakening from her prolonged stupor, escaped the clutches of the lair, leaving behind the twisted enchantments that had held her captive. In her insatiable hunger for power, Aivridyt, assuming the guise of Ghuse, a human guard captain and cleric devoted to Algath, the goddess of life and death, plotted her ascent in the city of Gorthugke. From the shadows, she manipulated her way to the pinnacle of military command, her influence spreading like a dark stain across the region. In tandem, she concocted a macabre alliance with Grezar, a necromancer dwelling among the dragonborn of Nurderad. The nefarious Grezar orchestrated a vengeful assault upon the Tolfoddund dwarves, reaping havoc upon their land—a cruel act of retribution for the Creep’s past transgressions. It was also Grezar that, years before, sent Miraak much too young to battle, where his body and soul burned, becoming a faint memory of a once fearless dragonborn warrior. 2.10 Interlude: A dream of Makab In the depths of their wearied minds, some of the Glasrath defenders share a nightmare, one that plagued their restless slumber. This nightmarish vision transported them to an ancient temple shrouded in the mists of the sea - a place of forgotten rituals and unspeakable horrors. Within the dream, they found themselves thrust into the midst of a sinister ceremony, their presence intended to thwart the unfolding ritual. Yet, as the dream progressed, a chilling realisation dawned upon them - the Glasrath defenders themselves were integral to the very ritual they sought to disrupt. Their every action, their every step, was predetermined, inexorably woven into this malevolent enchantment. Enigmatic beings, known as Ngar’thos, stood as mere witnesses, their forms twisted and alien, indifferent to the mortals’ plight. And at the centre of it all stood the Eldritch Furnace, a conduit to realms unimaginable, where Ethux’zhurh, an embodiment of The Void, awaited its unwitting prey. As the dream neared its crescendo, Kimbarak, driven by desperation and armed with a golden dagger, believed it to be his salvation - a weapon that could sever the grasp of The Void and restore balance. But the cruel irony of the nightmare unfolded before their eyes. As Kimbarak raised the dagger, it was not The Void that was halted, but Kimbarak himself who became ensnared within the swirling tapestry of reality, forever condemned to serve as a slave spirit to the ancient horrors that lurked beyond. With despair gnawing at their hearts, the remaining defenders made a fateful decision - to flee the accursed temple and escape the clutches of Ethux’zhurh. Their footsteps echoed through the corridors and inhumane rooms, a desperate bid for survival. Yet, Guilf’s dream diverged from the others, his nightmare ending with a chilling embrace by The Void itself, an all-encompassing darkness that dragged him relentlessly into the unfathomable depths of the sea. Miraculously, the surviving defenders, in a stroke of sheer luck, managed to sail away from the awakening Ethux’zhurh, evading its wrath and preserving their tenuous hold on existence. 2.11 Chapter 12 Finding Holzander once more In the shadowed enclave of Durnum, the broken Glasrath defenders sought refuge among the stoic dwarves, their journey fraught with despair and uncertainty. Amyria, ever the beacon of compassion, extended a benevolent hand to the famine-stricken dwarves. Her words promised respite from the relentless Dust Elf traders who, under the merciless rule of Neeleu, demanded burdensome tributes. As the heroes conversed with Glorizerlug Chaosfoot, the dwarven elder revealed the secrets of Durnum’s origins. The mining enclave had been hewn from the very bedrock of an ancient construction shaft, a subterranean passageway that linked to the tunnels of Ammuinoth. From the lips of Chaosfoot, they learned of the grim state of affairs in the southern realms, a harrowing tale of defeat and despair that had driven the Kiranu dwarves to forsake their mountain abodes. Their desperate exodus northward had been shielded by the stalwart Nurderad Dragonborn, but the heroes’ hearts grew heavy with dread. In the midst of their deliberations, Dolman’s heart wrestled with a terrible choice. His Kirano kin, vulnerable and threatened, called out to him from the south. Yet, the enigmatic secrets of Holzander Castle where his mother has been lost a decade ago. A heavy silence hung over the party as they made their fateful decision to press onward to the castle, hearts heavy with the weight of unresolved choices. It was Guilf, his mind forged in the fires of bardic curiosity, who delved into the thoughts of the dwarves. Through their collective memory, he gleaned the knowledge they sought—the hidden path to Holzander Castle, an invaluable revelation that saved them precious hours of fruitless searching in the unforgiving desert. With resolve renewed, the broken heroes embarked on the desert trail, their passage serene until they reached the ancient ruins of Dannamore. Here, beneath a tumultuous thunderstorm that cast jagged forks of lightning across the heavens, they found themselves pursued by a vengeful storm spirit, a tempest incarnate. Within the crumbling confines of Dannamore’s ruins, the weary travelers stumbled upon an unexpected encounter—a band of Anak Warriors, also fleeing the encroaching southern conflict. In a tragic twist of fate, Kethra, her instincts awry, launched a fateful assault upon the unsuspecting Anaks. The ensuing clash was fierce and sorrowful, and amidst the chaos, Miraak fell upon the cold stonefrom a grievous wound inflicted by a nimble Anak hidden in the ruins. In the end, the broken heroes emerged victorious, yet the taste of innocent blood upon their hands was a bitter and haunting reminder of their choices. Amidst these tumultuous events, Guilf seized another chance to commune with The Void, an entity that loomed over him like a shadowy spectre. The revelation struck like a thunderbolt—Guilf’s very soul had been pledged to this malevolent force, a debt owed by his own mother in a dark covenant of ages past. Now, within the ominous embrace of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes stood at a crossroads of destiny, their past and future intertwined in the eldritch tapestry of fate. 2.12 Chapter 13 The Ancient Elven Library In the labyrinthine depths of Holzander Castle, the broken heroes found themselves enmeshed in a web of arcane intrigue. Danaska, the scholarly seeker of forbidden knowledge, had a request—a sinister task she desired accomplished. She wished for Cagoth-Ze, a master of time manipulation and a rival scholar, to be removed from the equation. The heroes, their spirits burdened by the enigma of the castle, were hesitant to oblige. Their path diverged, leading them to Cagoth-Ze’s chamber, where they learned of the mage’s own desire to eliminate Danaska. Once again, the group declined the call to violence. Cagoth-Ze, however, was not to be deterred. The master of time offered an alternative proposal—an arrangement in which the group would eliminate the imprisoned Ngar’tho within the summoning circle. But the heroes, weary of treacherous bargains and the siren call of dark deeds, once more turned down the offer. Thus, they ventured into the presence of the imprisoned Ngar’tho, an ancient entity yearning for freedom. It sought nothing but release, offering valuable information in return for its emancipation. In the end, the broken heroes struck a bargain with the Ngar’tho, a pact sealed with knowledge and secrets. The entity divulged the whereabouts of Galiera, held captive on the castle’s elusive third level by the Blighted, a race ensnared by the malevolent Gellert. Furthermore, it unveiled the cryptic path to the hidden library, concealed within the tapestry of time itself. With the Ngar’tho liberated, Cagoth-Ze believed the heroes had fulfilled their part of the bargain and welcomed them into his realm within the castle’s second level. There, they encountered a time construct, a paradoxical creation that would transport them through the temporal currents to the fabled library. The journey through the ever-shifting tides of time was a disorienting and surreal experience. The heroes glimpsed fleeting imprints of the world’s past and future, each image a fleeting echo of reality, each moment pregnant with foreboding. After hours spent within the library, delving into tomes of arcane wisdom and timeless mysteries, the heroes returned to their present time with the time construct. It was at this pivotal juncture that the group found itself divided, their destinies pulling them in disparate directions. Dolman, Guilf, and Amyria were resolute in their quest to rescue Galiera from the clutches of the Blighted on the third level. Meanwhile, Miraak and Kethra, their hearts aflame with the burning desire for justice and retribution, chose to confront Ghuse, the dark puppeteer who had manipulated their fates. With heartfelt farewells and whispered hopes of reunification in the uncertain future, the heroes embarked on their divergent paths within the enigmatic depths of Holzander Castle. 2.13 Chapters 14 &amp; 15: The Deepfolk In the shadowed depths of Holzander Castle, the Glasrath champions pressed forward into the foreboding third level, their path fraught with peril and uncertainty. Before they embarked on this treacherous journey, Cagoth-Ze, the time arcanist, bestowed upon them an unexpected gift—an ancient construct known as Brilhorte 3000. Cagoth-Ze explained that Brilhorte 3000 had been a steadfast guardian in his own trials and tribulations, a stalwart companion to guide them through the labyrinthine darkness of the castle. The heroes welcomed their new mechanical ally with gratitude and camaraderie, their party now augmented by this enigmatic presence. With introductions exchanged and Brilhorte 3000 by their side, the champions descended the stairwell leading deeper into the abyss of the third level. The landing was shrouded in impenetrable darkness, an eerie silence clinging to the air, broken only by faint, disquieting footsteps that hinted at the presence of hidden horrors. Guilf, ever perceptive, caught sight of Deepfolk warriors through narrow arrow slits in a dimly lit corridor to the south. They were positioned strategically, ready to unleash their deadly arrows upon any intruders. A sudden and treacherous turn of events revealed itself as Brilhorte, acting upon some capricious twist of fate, unwittingly triggered a trap. The south door creaked open, and a merciless iron gate descended behind the heroes, locking them in a perilous bottleneck. The Deepfolk warriors, trained to precision and armed with fearsome giant sword spiders, converged upon the heroes from all directions. Brilhorte, inexplicably, shifted into a dormant, inactive form—a twist of fate forewarned by Cagoth-Ze. What ensued was a relentless and protracted battle, an unyielding clash of wills and steel. Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf fought valiantly, dispatching many of their adversaries, but the Deepfolk, their numbers vast and their tactics cunning, gradually drove the heroes into a dire predicament, cornering them at the entrance to the third level. In a desperate gambit, Guilf conceived a daring plan. He would approach the Deepfolk alone, with Amyria and Dolman concealed. He would declare himself to be Imortra’s son and offer himself willingly. Miraculously, the audacious ploy succeeded, and Bjrnyar, the leader of the Deepfolk, agreed to take Guilf captive, instructing his comrades to hunt down and eliminate the other intruders. Meanwhile, Amyria, Dolman, and the now reactivated Brilhorte prepared an ambush for the two Deepfolk warriors hot on their trail. In a swift and brutal skirmish, they felled their foes, ensuring that the pursuit ended in their favor. Guilf, despite being in Bjrnyar’s grasp, managed to break free just moments before the Deepfolk were to hand him over to their comrades. Bjrnyar, determined not to let his quarry escape, commanded the Deepfolk Shaman unit to join the fray once more, while he pursued Guilf with relentless resolve. Brilhorte, once again dormant, lay inert. The Glasrath champions, acting swiftly and decisively, fled from the approaching Deepfolk. Their efforts to evade their pursuers proved futile, as the Deepfolk detected their presence in the landing room, the very place where the Ngar’tho had been imprisoned. Another frantic and harrowing battle erupted, culminating in one of the Deepfolk warriors fleeing in terror. However, the situation escalated as the heavy Deepfolk Shaman unit ascended the stairs, their ominous march resonating with a cacophony of armoured boots against the stone steps. Desperate to escape, the heroes sought refuge aboveground, arriving at the same level where they had last encountered Ushulx. What they beheld there was a scene of profound anguish—Scar, the ogre who had allied with them, lay sacrificed by Ushulx’s cruel hands. In that heart-wrenching moment, the champions vowed to exact vengeance upon Ushulx when they crossed her path again. As they ventured back to the first level of the castle, they were met with a disconcerting sight—undead entities flickered in and out of reality, a haunting manifestation that defied the boundaries of the living and the dead. Summoning their resolve, the heroes made a courageous decision—to return to the second level of the castle and investigate the Deepfolk unit they had left behind. There, they found Cagoth-Ze, coerced and threatened by Bjrnyar to serve as an informant for the Deepfolk, should the heroes dare to return. Yet, Bjrnyar had not anticipated Guilf’s ability to communicate telepathically with Cagoth-Ze. The gnome mage revealed the positions of the Deepfolk within the library, granting the champions a strategic advantage. With this newfound knowledge, Dolman, Amyria, and Guilf laid an ambush for Bjrnyar and his companions. In a swift and decisive strike, Dolman’s Halberd cleaved through the Deepfolk war leader’s armour with deadly precision, ending his life in a cataclysmic stroke. The remaining Deepfolk, still unaware of their impending doom, combed through the level in search of the heroes who had eluded them. Unbeknownst to them, the champions had already ascended to the surface, seeking refuge in the desolate Dannamore Hold. Outside the castle, an ominous sight awaited them—a colossal umbilical of energy connected the fortress to the heavens, its ominous significance shrouded in darkness. On their journey to Eyaram, the heroes encountered a group of Mercian commoners who spoke of the prophecy of Ethux’zhurh’s awakening, drawing many to Linhe. They described a dreadful spectacle—a gaping black fracture tearing through the heart of the desert. Amyria, Dolman, and Guilf resolved to protect the commoners on their path to Eyaram. But as they neared their destination, the night bore witness to the chilling manifestation of the commoners’ fears—an otherworldly fracture in reality, from which three reality-flickering spiders emerged, their presence heralding an imminent and indescribable terror. 2.14 Chapter 16: Madness in Eyaram In the ever-twisting labyrinth of their perilous journey, the beleaguered Glasrath champions found themselves ensnared in yet another malevolent embrace, their battle-worn bodies craving only the respite of the Fort City of Eyaram. But it was not to be so simple, for even in the supposed stronghold city, the tendrils of an insidious presence reached out to bind their minds. The city’s twisted streets, warped by hallucinations spawned from the darkest corners of the unknown, unfolded before them. Deja vu gripped their thoughts like the gnarled fingers of some eldritch puppeteer, and the very angles of construction defied the laws of reason. Laughter, high-pitched and maddening, echoed through the alleys, sung by spectral children who should never exist. Days slipped by like phantoms, and Amyria, ever the beacon of insight, slowly unraveled the nightmarish tapestry that enshrouded them. It was a Ngar’tho, those mind-warping entities, whose invisible hands pulled the strings of their torment. In an audacious gambit, Guilf ventured to interrogate their elusive tormentor. The words echoed in the hollow chasms of their consciousness, seeking answers within the dark recesses of the Ngar’tho’s enigmatic intentions. Why had they been chosen as playthings for this malevolent entity’s cruel games? The response, whispered through the abyss of thought, was chilling in its simplicity: Ethux’zhurh was poised to unveil its terrible pronouncements to all. The plight of the inhabitants of Linhe and the undead horrors festering the desert sands were but petty squabbles, trifles that buzzed like flies upon the desert’s cruel winds in the eyes of this eldritch being. A week wore on, each day an agonising journey through a city steeped in the macabre. They encountered broken souls, remnants of once-vivid aspirations. Amongst these wretched inhabitants, they met Eleni, a dust elf trader whose wares outweighed her capacity to sell. A paradox of prosperity turned to burden, she offered potions and arcane stones, their very existence a lifeline in this desolate place. Then there was Marcus, a senior knight fervent in his belief in the primacy of Faletism. He whispered of a plot to wrest control of the FFKA East from the grasp of Sergarus, a design that, though bloodless, bore ominous risks. The tidings brought forth a revelation—the FFKA believed the heart of the undead menace lay hidden in Glasrath. Finally, amidst the maddening symphonies of a Mercian house, their senses were assaulted by music and perverse indulgences. There, in the throes of fleshly excess, revelations spilled forth like tainted wine. A revelation carved with Imortra’s name—a name that resonated as the architect of a new Mercian cult that had entrapped them in the inescapable web of Linhe’s shadows. None of these plans and dreams would endure, dashed like fragile glass beneath the relentless march of thousands rotting feet, with no heroes remaining to shield them, as the Glasrath champions went back to Holzander, the supposed root of the evil. 2.15 Chapter 17 &amp; 18 Mothers In the first night of their travel, the Glasrath champions encounter another infected Lady Scurvy. They are powerful now and quickly kill the creature. After some investigation, they learn that the infection is of an alien origin, where one parasite creature is attached to the neck of a rather normal ghoul. This specific creature, seemed controlled by some kind of desire to consume others, but entertained the construction of some kind of altar until the broken heroes found it and destroyed it. The altar contained a stone with the names of Kimbarak and Ethux’zhurh, related to some kind of ancient dark ritual. The following days of travel were less dangerous, although some dark visions occured to each of the champions. guilf was the first one, and had a melancholic vision of the world being uncreated by the current powers in play. Next Dolman, after a confusing dream, came to realise that different than all the other undead they have battled for so long, these new “reality flickering” creatures had no smell. Finally, amyria suddely succumbs to some call from the desert and, on her knees and hands in the sand, feels the weight of so many layers of civilisation after civilisation whose ruins scatter the desert in unmemorable depths - and all those that died when civilisations collapse, now their bodies ready to be reanimated for some dark cause. The peril is immense. The party finds their way into the Holzander castle for one more time, and learn from Cagoth-ze that there is some intense power struggle for leadership amongst the Deepfolk, after Bjrnyar was killed. Guilf decides to investigate the Deepfolk level from the collapsed floor of the library, and sees a body on the top of the rubble pile. In a smart and stealth move, he ties the body and rescue it to the floor above, before the Deepfolk realise their bait has been removed. The body is dolman’s mother - Gaelira. She is not dead, but instead in some coma state. Reading her mind, Guilf finds buried a cognitive distress call: “The world is going to end. The Brezal paths have to be disentangled from the castle’s artefacts to release the tension. The Arcane Furnace, The Crystal Platform and the Sphere of Annihilation must be destroyed.” With this goal clear in their head, the broken heroes go to Danaska first, as the master of oozes have been using the Alchemist Furnace for years now. Amyria, in a high morale decision, intimidates Danaska to step away, and the ooze scholar decides to leave the castle. After failing their first attempt to disable the furnace, the heroes decide to climb down to the Deepfolk level, and stealthily take them down. They almost succeed, but before the first foes can be killed in silent, one of them whistles, signalling intrudes to the others. The party is quickly surrounded and, once Dolman falls unconscious shot down by a dozen arrows, the group’s morale is shaken and they give in. The Deepfolk takes their armours and weapons and call in the Derro, from the level below, to take the group to Imortra. After climbing down through a hole they are received by Derril and, in that minute, Brilhorte who was in the block form inside the sack with all the weapons and armours, turns back into his humanoid form. Surprised, Derril makes a lame attack with a club, which is easily parried by Brilhorte, who then decapitates the Derro. For about half an hour, the group discussed what to do, and tried a few options. In the end, they decide to peacefully approach the other Derro, who did not seem to intend harm. Brilhorte goes back to his block form. As the broken heroes meet Gilsfeyr, priest of the Derro bat-cult, they learn of a plan to take down Imortra. The Derro have been her though-prisoners for decades, and want freedom. The plan includes a partnership with Kuku, the leader of the Derro village who share this caverns with the bat-cult. After agreeing with Gilsfeyr and Kuku, the party takes some mushroom tea, which supposedly gives them true sight on reality, as the Derro explain this will be required. And then walk towards Imortra and her supporters. Imortra is expecting the three heroes. Amyria and Guilf try in vain to convince Imortra that her means are evil, and that others are suffering. Imortra’s sweet arguments seem strong, and she explains that all of them are of utmost importance for summoning The Void. Amyria will act as a conduit for Thalia’s power, that will channel to Dolman, who holds the spirt of Kimbarak, and is able to stop the Legacy powers that protect reality against the violence that the summoning ritual represents. Finally, Guilf will be the lighthouse for The Void, so that the powerful god can reach his destination. The heroes decide to pretend to follow Imortra’s plan, with the concealed motivation to use the opportunity to destroy the sphere of annihilation and save the Angel Hound without summoning The Void. Although Guilf is still inclined to continue with the ritual. The deal is settled when Imortra orders Gailiera to be brought down, and one of the Ngar’tho attends to her mental wounds, and the group prepares to enter what Imortra described as land of Nightmares. 2.16 Chapter 19 The Nightmare River The broken heroes debated a plan: go deeper in the holzanderCastle, find Gellert and kill him. After that they will think on how to destroy the artefacts in the castle. With true sight teas in a canteen, they venture into the abyss of a nightmare. In the dark cave below, they see a river and a boatman. The boatman requires payment to take them in other locations in the river, and they promptly ask to be taken to Gellert. The boats starts navigating but finds a rocky area. Dolman, Amyria and Guilf have to cross the rocks on foot. Joyfully trying to copy Dolman’s athletics aptitude in the jumps, Guilf falls into the river, awakening dark souls around them. After fighting a lady_scurvy and evourecs’ attempts to grapple and connect to the broken heroes intellects, the group safely resumes the navigation on the river, with the boatman that now waiting them after the rocks. From the river, a nightmarish humanoid-experiment (Wilbur Whateley) starts talking with the group, explaining that all the rooms in the river are laboratories used by the Ngar’tho. He also tells the sad story of his wife, who has been deconstructed and made into the walls of one of the rooms. The group finally arrives in a stone landing, with a small construction attached in one of the cavern walls and a staircase on the other side. Dolman and Guilf climb up the stairs, and find themselves on different places, so they retract. Looking through the construction’s door keyhole, Guilf sees a shadow servant organising the “house”. After asking the boatman again to be taken to Gellert, the vessel starts navigating in the opposite direction, and the group find themselves repeating what they had just experienced backwards. They continue until another landing, where Dolman asks the boatman to stop. After some careful investigation, the heroes learn they just avoided a trap, where Deep Ones were planning to arrow them to death in a corner of the river. In a strategic move, the party holds the door shut, while a nightmare darkness is cast within the room with the Deep Ones. Only one ventures outside, barely alive, and is then put to death. Through another door, the group hears a ritual chanting, and through an inquiry with the dead Deep One they learn The Void is within the walls of that room, hurt. Focused on finding Gellert, another journey demand is made to the boatman, which conducts the boat for the third time through the same place. The heroes don’t exactly know anymore which way is which. The broken heroes continued their journey through the nightmare. Amyria decided to explore the caverns with her spiritual eye and found they are locked in a loop of dual realities, with rooms cycling back to other rooms. They find Gellert and a long friendly conversation happens. Gellert shares about the accident that created a sphere of annihilation, and how the Angel Hound was lost to it. Gellert also proposes riches to Amyria, Dolman and Guilf if they were to destroy the sphere. The group debates a plan again, and after what seems to have been months locked in the nightmare, they decide to go downstairs. As part of the nightmares, the group helps Wilbur Whateley’s desire to finish the life of his wife (Mary) and his own. While the heroes execute it, a ngar-tho observes. Upon encountering the sphere, the group is prepared to face it, and after a short but dangerous exchange, they manage to break up the sphere. The Angel Hound was locked inside, but now not just what it was - it seems to be part of the Ngar’tho shared intellect. 2.17 Chapter 20 Waking Up After resting for what felt like years, Amyria, Guilf and Dolman decide to leave Gellert’s dwelling with a plan to rescue Gaelira. They are older and look dirtier and meaner. Guilf is now an adult. They seem more and more under the control of their ancestral spirits: Kimbarak, The Void and Thalia - and that scared the group. Before they leave, Gellert pays his part of the agreement and hands over three powerful rings: Ring of Earth, Ring of Sun and Ring of Command. The three heroes go upstairs and explain to the ngar-tho that a part of the ritual requires them to take Gaelira out of the castle. The Ngar’tho seems uncertain, and shares that coming back to the castle might be difficult once they leave. The group is not deterred, and they climb up to the third level, where the Imortra’s Deepfolk reside. On that level, a very short exchange of words teaches the Deepfolk that this group is not to be messed with, and the soldiers back off. The original path they descended to this level of the castle, when they first came in, is now blocked, but they quickly learn from the Deepfolk that the stables tunnel can also be used to leave directly to the desert. Once in the tunnel, Amyria is the first one to use her ring, and conjured a sun’s light from her eyes to observer the world beyond sand and stone. She sees a camp a mile from their current location, and the group decides to travel there. The camp is a strange one. A mix of dust elves, dwarves and humans are gathered together to do what they call “Laying Low”. The heroes meet the camp leader Clotilde, a bearded dwarf woman, and their minds start to shatter when they realise 25 years have passed. The people from the camp are laying low to hide themselves from the several battles happening in the desert, in a war that has started now a decade ago. On the next morning the heroes are determined to find the castle again, the original entrance through Mystra’s door. Still carrying Gaelira unconscious, they see risks in going through the first level, now taken by hundreds of undead. Dolman decides to use his own ring now, and very quickly finds passage through earth and stone for the group. As they navigate the earth, they find other passages in the castle they never knew about. Once they reach Cagoth-Ze the gnome is astonished to meet them again, thinking they perished decades ago. After a friendly conversation, the group convinces Cagoth to summon a Ngar’tho again, this time with Gaelira within the summoning circle. Cagoth is afraid of the plan, but is convinced. The Ngar’tho is summoned, but things do not go as planned. The creature has no desire to be quickly released, and time pressure would not convince it to wake Gaelira up. The next plan involves leaving Cagoth with the Ngar’tho for a few hours, while Amyria, Guilf and Dolman navigate through earth again and ambush Gellert. The fight begins with Dolman and Guilf falling crying over their own madness, but the group quickly recovers and Gellert is destroyed. The entire exchange lasted no more than 20 seconds. They didn’t talk. The group comes back to Cagoth (7 years later), only to find that the summoning circle failed for a millisecond, enough time for Cagoth to be slay by the Ngar’tho. The corpse is left in the floor, with a face of agony. He suffered. After the sad events, the group decides to use Cagoth’s machine, which continue to work, to visit the Elven Library once more. They learn that only another powerful creature, such as an old dragon, would be able to circumvent the Ngar’tho’s mind control over Gaelira. They also learn that the creatures known as Angels (also called Acrisae in other languages) have been in war with humankind for millennia. Armed with this knowledge, and a lot of emotional baggage, the group prepares to leave to Mystra’s Temple. The temple might be a drop of hope in the current sea of misery.

But this time the robot is different - stronger, larger and darker. A few minutes later a swarm of Evourec’s attack the Glasrath Champions. The fight is easy, unlike comprehending how and why these creatures of water are moving around in the desert. On the next day the group walks fast, and reach the broken statue of The Void again. This time Guilf shows little excitement with it. Just before dawn, Amyria pretends to guard while reading the book of knowledge. A sneaky elf, Filarion, gets close and calls Amyria. The group is told that Filarions and the remainder of their friends are living in a crevasse nearby, and had picked up a fight with the wrong foe. What appeared to be a dirty hermit turned out to be a powerful angel, and the group is now being hunted by it for trying to steal its sword. The Glasrath Champions were not excited with the proposition and instead, convinced 3 out of the 5 friends to continue travelling with them, instead of living in the crevasse. Amyria ends up being cursed by one that is staying behind - but that did not last long. The champions and their 3 new travel companions now travel underground, in the maze of ruins and tunnels beneath the desert. Thirteen, the scout of Filarion’s group is a skilful traveller through the tunnels. As Amyria continues to read the book of knowledge, she gets seduced by it, and start to loose herself in it. In one of the evenings she seems to have waken up a nightmare, which turned out to be powerful and attacked the group. In a hard fight, one of the new companions died of fear, while the other one run away. Amyria cast a godlike figure protecting Thirteen and Galiera from the nightmare. Thirteen holdfast and stayed, proving his new acquired loyalty to the Champions, and a devotion to Guilf. The group regathers their strength and continue for a few more days, when they meet Mustroc Heavymace - one of the survivors of the Battle for Ammuinoth. Mustroc explains that Ghuse has, over the last decades, set an industrious economy of mining and weapon building, that supplies both sides of the ongoing war.

The chains continue to be laid between the dragon and the FFKA, in catenary while the dragon flies. - The dragon quickly kill all the fighters in the temple, while Guilf is tossed by Dolman with a Congealed Paradox. He crushes the stone, and the dragon’s gold adorns and chains immediately fall and break. - For a split second, it seemed that the dragon would stop his carnage, but it does not. The Retreat - The champions guide the survivors, with the help of Thirteen to walk the ruined tunnels towards Glasrath. - With Dolma’s ring, they go through earth and investigate where the chains connected to, and it seems to be some kind of catapult basket. - The champions meet the survivors again en route to Glasrath and they continue. 3.7 Chapter 27: Finale The Glasrath Heroes (as they call themselves now) arrive in Glasrath, bringing the survivors from the Drakvarden attack to Mystra’s temple. As they speak with Ghuse, they learn that the host of the FFKA is coming to the mountains. They explain to Ghuse that the FFKA has been using dwarves as draconic weapons. Ghuse now becomes afraid, as he knows many dwarves were captured in the last 6 months. Dolman meets his father again, who has been able to arrive in Glasrath because of the messengers of Guilf. The heroes discuss what their options are, and how to stop the war. Amyria consults Mystra, who manifests again. Mystra is now weak, but has chosen a side - she asks Amyria to support Golab, and pledges for Mr. Void to not be awakened. Khatadzig is evacuated, and everyone retreats to the forge through the mountains. The heroes decide to go to the Acrisae war camp, and are able to meet one of Golab’s commanders. The commander explains that the war would not be necessary, if the Sorcerer-King Loquiroth is finally captured or destroyed. The heroes then travel to the Forge, and using they’s powers break into the Kernel. Inside lies Loquiroth. A battle ensues and Loquiroth is spent, but still able to loose his form and vanishes The heroes destroy as much as they can of the Kernel, before Turnskull forces arrive. They then jump from the Kernel and softly land below. It is easy to leave the Forge. They travel back to meet the caravan with all the people from Glasrath. How will them protect their families that are accompanying Ghuse? With Ghuse, they consider their alternatives: the Acrisae, partnered with the FFKA, is not one, while the Turnskull are now too weak and disorganised. Guilf’s opinion is that Mr. Void is the only remaining alternative. After heated discussions the group agrees to go to the Holzander Castle. Upon arrival, they are received by the Ngar’tho, who have been chanting since they last left, preparing for the ritual. Conversing with the shared mind of the Ngar’tho, they take the boat on the river under the castle, and reach the ritual room. The maimed body of Mr Void lay on the bottom of a ritualistic pool. Guilf follows his heart, and starts the ritual by proposing to Amyria. "],["epilogue.html", "Chapter 4 Epilogue", " Chapter 4 Epilogue For the next year, Mr Void’s power ravage the Acrisae host. The FFKA is pushed north again, in despair. Amyria and Guilf also travel north in search for a monastery to pray. Dolman spends most of the war years depressed on his own thoughts. In the coming decades Amyria and Guilf raise 3 children, and like with her first husband, Amyria lives with Guilf until he dies of age. Dolman continues his life with his family in the Glasrath mountains, setting up a new dwarven kingdom.

Expanded map, based on the Atlas of The Latter Earth. |500 Six major geographical features: - Glasrath Mountains and Mines - Shangu Mountains - Ammuinoth - Huethigue swamps and plains - Ice arratu - Delsinese Ice Sheets Six nations or groups of importance: - Kingdom of Oivepia and the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch - Hincland Mercians and the Deepfolk - D’Elsinese Anak Tribes - Nurderad Praetorian Nation and the Lance Defenders - Kimbarak Countries of Glasrath and Kiranu - Acrisae (Angels) A.1.1 Katho The Kathan Empire In the vast desert of Maqqatba lies Katho, an empire built on the ruins of a long-forgotten civilisation. The people of the empire are hardy and resourceful, able to survive in the harsh conditions of the desert through their ingenuity and determination. Katho’s lands in the sourth have always been coveted by the aberrations and frozen monstrosities of the D’elsinese Empire. The war between the two kingdoms has lasted for centuries, with neither side gaining a clear military advantage. The current rulers of Katho have already committed most of their available armies to the war, and the empire is now anguished. Military alliances have existed for the last ten years. Neighbouring lands such as Foucheresia (to the west), and their fierce dragonborn host, and Romburghia (to the east) have pledged support for Katho. As the war persist, people of the desert empire have grown weary of the conflict. Some in the north are questioning the motives of their rulers and their willingness to sacrifice so many lives for the sake of power and control. Whispers of rebellion and unrest are growing louder in the capital in the north, Throtha. Meanwhile, the entire northern region has been battling their own problems, including the spree of Lady Scurvy and the Faletism religious takeover. A.1.2 Romburgh Romburghia is a troubled land, rife with tension, secrets and fear. Its people are divided by culture and religion, and its aristocracy is on the brink of collapse. A coastal kingdom, located on the east of Maqqatba, Romburghia is bordered by the Khathan Empire to the west. It is also the only land access of Hincland to the continent, making it a strategically important location. At the heart of Romburghia’s power struggles lies a fragmented aristocratic organisation, where no one is sure of their own power. The titular ruler, surrounded by a web of spying and blackmail, is feared by all who cross their path. Meanwhile, the ruler’s lover and the court sorcerer hold strong position and influence, using their power to manipulate the court’s fragile balance. The kingdom is a patchwork of cultures, with the north being dominated by the ancient Mercian ways, while the south is a vast expanse of nomadic Nurfirth. However, the original Mercian religion has long been in decline, with most of the country now following either the church of Falet or the gods of the Yotunn Ancestors pantheon. The Faletism religion has officially been adopted by the kingdom, but it is a decision made out of fear, for the Mercians of Hincland have long been rumored to dabble in black magic. The rulers have turned a blind eye to non-conventional approaches to converting folk religion followers to the official religion of Falet, desperately seeking to expand its reach and hold over the kingdom. A.1.3 Nurderad Theme: Decadence &amp; Legitimacy (wwn124) Court: Lance Defenders FFKA is growing in influence in the nation. Nurderad has always helped with perils in Maqqatba. The war in the south is exhausting Nurderad. The pyramid (working) has been activated. In the heart of the Nurdead Praetorian Nation, the capital city of Djerad Thymar stood as a testament to both grandeur and mystery. Whispers carried on the wind spoke of its renown, spreading tales of awe and trepidation throughout the realms. Djerad Thymar, a name that resonated with both reverence and fear, boasted a breathtaking sight that defied mortal imagination. Rising from the earth like a colossal beast of ancient lore, the entire city took the form of a hollow pyramid. Its architecture, a testament to the architects’ twisted genius, rendered it virtually impenetrable to all but the most daring of intruders. Built upon a foundation of unyielding granite, the pyramid stood proudly, its towering height reaching a dizzying 1,500 feet (460 meters) into the sky. A sight that evoked a mix of wonder and unease in the hearts of those who dared to gaze upon it. As if nature itself had conspired with the hands of men, a vast number of columns rose in unison, lending unwavering support to the massive structure above. A wide ramp, the only gateway to this labyrinthine fortress, beckoned the curious to venture into its depths. Guarded by ancient sentinels and encircled by a sparse collection of farms and humble homesteads, the city stood in stark contrast to the sprawling private domains of the opulent clans. These privileged elite, drawn to the power and allure of Djerad Thymar, chose to erect their opulent estates within the decaying remnants of the long-lost Iopothae civilization, their proximity to the city a constant reminder of the shadows that lingered in its wake. A.1.4 Oivepia Theme: Expansion &amp; Stratification (wwn124) Court: Faletist Knights of the Arc Suspected of ethnicity cleansing. Their culture is widely admired. A blighted horde is threatening its borders. A horrible monster was driven off. A.1.5 Hincland Theme: Decadence &amp; Pageantry (wwn124) Court: Mercians A usurper is being sheltered here. Their ruling classes are related to Oivepia’s. The leadership is inept/distracted. A noble heir shows signs of heroic greatness. Link with Mercian A.1.6 D’Elsin Theme: Barbarism &amp; Stratification (wwn124) Court: Turnskull Constructs, driving Anak Tribes At war with Katho, Kiranu &amp; Nurderad. A hero from Hincland is now in D’Elsin. Turnskull has disgorged Made Gods. Splendid resources have been reestablished in Turnskull. A.1.6.1 Anaks Source: wwn306: Sages believe that the original Anakim were a spite-weapon created by the Outsiders when the fall of their hegemony seemed imminent. Captured rebels, still-subject Deeps, and human traitors who were no longer needed were used as the feedstock for the transformation, one intended to create a sentient bioweapon for the destruction of all human and demihuman life in the Latter Earth. Later ages saw the Anakim modified by assorted Imperators, their original nature warped and tuned to serve the purposes of the experimenters. The resulting Anakim sub-species are sometimes drastically different from the ur-Anak, but the intrinsic selfishness, cruelty, and aggression of the base stock persist in most of them. A.1.7 Kimbarak Theme: Exhaustion &amp; Unity (wwn124) Courts: Glasrath and Kiranu countries A dwarven working caused problems to the land in the past Dwarves in Glasrath were open to receive refugees during the Acrisae arrival The Kimbarak people are succumbing Glasrah is being restablished A.1.7.1 Tolfonddundhesm Tolfonddund Dwarven Mines The southern mine system on the Glasrath Mountains was created by dwarves coming from the town of Tolfoddund, two centuries ago (3671 NC). These dwarves were not as advanced as the Nargun dwarves, but made enough wealth by trading dwarven goods with Watheton (especially Yeswite), which then traded them to other peoples of the Kuzar County and, more broadly, with the Khathan empire. A.1.7.2 Nargunhesm Nargun Dwarven Mines The Nargun was a strong Dwarven empire founded in 3217 NC. The King was killed about 15 years ago, in an attack that came from the Ammuinoth, alongside his son and heir. Sitmeak Greybow, was then appointed as regent and has been the regent since - he is in charge. The brother, Whursock Greybow, is the commander of the army. A.2 Linhe Linhe County and Surroundings Genre: dark fantasy, folk and disaster horror Hallmarks: Dwindling resources, fickle hero worship, impending disaster, suspicion, totalitarianism, undead Area: 87 thousand square miles Population: Total population of 440 thousand (humans and demi-humans, mostly dust elves and some dwarves) Urban population: 32 thousand 6-mile hex population: 150 The sands of time bury the deserts of Linhe. Here, the wonders of fallen empires and temples of forgotten kings crumble beneath a merciless sun. Untold generations of tombs and secrets lie beneath the sands, markers of a history the land’s few residents know of only in story and song. Their interest in past splendor is smothered, as life is harsh in Linhe. Many of Linhe’s settlements lie in the middle of old and new ruins, its cities crumbling and unprotected, its villages abandoned and overgrown. Still, bastions of civilisation hold out against the the terrifying dangers of the region. Linhe is a land besieged. Empty countryside surrounds ruined or crumbling cities. A few desperate pockets of civilisation survive, carrying on not out of hope, but, in most of the region, out of fear of the FFKA’s merciless members. Led by Sergarus, the paramilitary group organises a desperate and occasionally effective defence against an implacable foe: the ever-growing armies of the dead. Where the FFKA East is strong, it has turned against the people, making them prisoners within their own country. With cudgel and pike, the soldiers of Falet force every commoner into gruelling labor, rushing them to raise fortifications and scrape ruins from the dirt. Every lash strike, every day of meagre rations is necessary - or so the soldiers claim - because time is short and the undead are coming. Every few months a new zombie legions issues from the Ghost Domain through caves and cracks in the wastelands. Never emerging from the same place twice, the horde sweeps across the land, drawn to the densest populations of the living. Causalities stack up during the zombie sieges, but miracles and moments of valour have not abandoned Linhe. The people’s numbers dwindle, but they soldier on. In the aftermath of an attack, the Linhans burn their dead, repair what they can, and whisper that now might be the time to flee. Invariably, though, someone speaks too loudly and a so-called traitor is impaled upon city walls. Noteworthy Features - Linhe is a land of vast deserts and rare, but deadly, storms. - Water is scarce beyond the land’s few oases and the cities. - The monuments, tombs, and pyramids of past golden ages litter Linhe. These countless tombs are interconnected, forming a vast, semi-hidden underground network through the Ammuinoth and the Ghost Domain. - FFKA soldiers patrol the land, hunting for deserters, looters, and strangers to press into service. Non-compliance is punished with impalement. - Individuals earn public or military esteem for special acts of heroism. Dubbed “Trueborn of Linhe,” these heroes are treated well, but the fickle public turns against them if they’re perceived as not doing enough to end the undead invasion. - Linhans value music, and many locals are accomplished singers or proficient in playing the reed pipe, goblet drum, or arched harp. |500 All the cities and villages on map (except Gimorkoc, which still follows the Yotunn Ancestors religion) have been over the decades converting to the northern religion known as Faletism. You are also told the northern cities do not speak the same common language as you do. The common language you’ve been speaking until now on the region is called Cold Nulfirther. In the northern cities they speak a dialect of this language called Sun Nulfirther, and also the official Khathan language. The Dust elves will speak all of these.

It is said it covered a larger region than the current The Kathan Empire. One of the features of the kingdom of Iopothae was the creation of the Ammuinoth (starting around year 1000 IT), a subterranean superstructure that traversed the kingdom (SW to NE), following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. Some researchers believe the energy paths are not real, and that the construction, in a leaf shape, was in deference to the old nature gods. In the Ammuinoth tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. The Ammuinoth was built by an alliance of immortal elves and dwarves for over a thousand years, which was responsible for shaping the races of the drow (dark elves) and the duergar (dark dwarves), as they ventured deeper and deeper over centuries. It is believed that the drow and duergar came into contact with some subterranean evil power, and were corrupted by it. But the corruption went unnoticed, until it was too late. It is not known when exactly, but around two millennia after the construction started the drow came across a god-built cavern system below the Ammuinoth. This was named the Ghost Domain (or the Underdark by the nowadays drows). The duergar did not venture often to the Ghost Domain, as it was too primitive for them. The Ammuinoth was built as a series of underground tunnels following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. In these tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. Now, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. On the map, in blue are Brezal Paths whose tunnels have collapsed or partially collapsed and in black are tunnels in work order. Nowadays, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. Even the better tunnels have several fractures, from where the Ghost Domain can be accessed. In every large construction in the Ammuinoth, access to the surface and the ghost domain were built - but some of them are now lost. Dwellers of the Ammuinoth: - Due to the access from the surface to the Ammuinoth: gangs of bandits and other scourge take lair and hide in the tunnels, in general everyone who wants to hide from society can be found there. - Due to the frequent connects with the Ghost Domain: most of the creatures from the ghost domain can be found here including fiends, undead, drows, duegar, even beholders! A.3.2 Ghost Domain and the Ophaire The Ghost Domain is grouped in layers: the Upper Domain (also known as Upperdark), the Lower Domain (also known as Middledark) and the Ophaire (also known as the Lowerdark, or the Dark Primitive). In the region where there is the Ammuinoth, it connects the surface to the Upper Domain, but it is also possible to go directly from the Upper Domain to the surface, although in very challenging cavern openings, mostly inaccessible for human sized creatures. As time went by, the drow and duergar grew apart: the duergar living in the Ammuinoth and in the north east area of the Upper Domain, while the drow lived in more deep areas of the Ghost Domain, mostly towards the south. The Ghost Domain’s underground landscape varies from small subterranean fissures almost impossible for adventurers to crawl through, to wide expanses of deep water that hides coral caves, hollowed out sections of ice in which creatures lived, and places where fungus, bones, or even pure force formed caves. This varied landscape is as dynamic as the surface. Some areas are always changing over time because of underground magma rivers or the emptying of underground lakes due to cracks in the rock formed by earthquakes. This meant maps of the Underdark were highly unreliable. The Upper Domain is about 4 Km deep, and it is inhabited by many dark-loving creatures (not necessarily evil ones). Some drow also live here, and sometimes some duergar too. The Lower Domain, 5 to 15 Km deep, is where the biggest drow cities exist, and drow nobility lives there. These drow are already too disconnected from the world above, and even duergar fear their evilness. Finally, deeper lies the Ophaire. It is not fully known if the dark primitive is still part of the world as a cavern system or if it is already some other type of dimension, as time and space seem to flow differently in such a depth. It is said the dark primitive lies between 20 and 100 Km from the surface, but these are all speculations. The deepest areas of the Ophaire are also known as Deadecho, and in these regions it is said that only true death can exist. It is said that in its depths, the shadow roads in the Ophaire access the Void - a region of madness and emptiness. The Deadecho, the dominion of [Algath]context/religions.md#Algath) (and the equally notorious Vardesain and Anu-Akma, fellow demigods of the dead), is notable for its silence - an existence of enormous deserts of bones, dunes of dust, and rivers of blood and tears. These are the dry lands, where life extends past its appointed span, where fate itself is thwarted with regularity, and where liches, vampires, and ghouls gather in enormous numbers to praise their patron and the font of vileness, to cheat death, to praise their protection against a certain voyage into the hells and the joy and strength of the god of the undead and his near-infinite legions. Deadecho, Plane of Undeath (MWB 46) - Evermaw is confused with the Eleven Hells, since it is an afterlife of ghouls and vampires, cannibals and gluttons. A road like a lolling tongue sprawls through a waterless desert of blood dust, passing towers that sprout like crooked white teeth, until it’s swallowed by the gulletlike sinkhole that houses the city of Vulture’s Beyond, osseous capital of the Hunger God Vardesain, as well as the Eternal Palace of the dry undead lord Mot and the Crystal Necropolis of the guardian god Anu-Akma. Here ziggurats flow with the blood of daily sacrifices, liches study new necromancies of flesh and bone, and the cooks claim they can skin and butcher anything, from ghosts to gods. A.3.3 Acrisae Theme: Renewal &amp; Hope (wwn124) They are forcing back all the region They fought with the elves in a long past Farmland is worning out A powerful artefact is helping the ruler "],["artefacts.html", "B Artefacts B.1 Sentinel Shield B.2 Gauntlets of Kimbarak Strenght B.3 Dread Mask B.4 Cloak of Bitter Luck B.5 Congealed Paradox", " B Artefacts B.1 Sentinel Shield Requires attunement While holding this shield, you have advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. The shield is emblazoned with the symbol of an eye. B.2 Gauntlets of Kimbarak Strenght Requires attunement Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher without them. B.3 Dread Mask The Void’s Hood of Telepathy, requires attunement Unknown origin. While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply–using a bonus action to do so–while your focus on it continues. While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can’t be used again until the next dawn. B.4 Cloak of Bitter Luck Mercian cloak, requires attunement Its textile was etched with ancient runes that glowed when activated with a pulsing, ethereal energy. The cloak had been woven by a long-dead wizard, who had imbued it with the power to harness the luck through air itself. It was said that the wizard had met a terrible fate, his body withered away from overuse of the cloak’ power. But despite the risks, many still sought out the cloak, eager to wield its incredible power and claim their place among the greatest mages in the land. The cloak is full of runes written in Qualith. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak. Any friendly creature within 60ft of the cloak can expend one sanity point to re-roll any dice that directly impacts oneself. B.5 Congealed Paradox Northern origin, required attunement These thumb-sized black gemstones are mildly painful to touch or look at, as each one contains an impossible duality that has been forcibly reconciled by ancient sorcery. When gripped and broken as a Main Action, the released paradox draws the immediate repression of the Legacy as mundane reality is violently reinforced in the surrounding 20 feet. Within that radius all active magic or psionic powers are immediately dispelled and no further power use can be performed inside it for the rest of the scene. Only celestial powers are immune to the paradox. Creatures reliant on magic or psionics for existence take 5d6 damage for each full round they spend inside this radius. Every usage requires a sanity check for those who observe the effects, 1d6 sanity cost if fail. History - Widely known item, Arcane check DC 8/15. - Created by a mad scholar from the Fifth Dynasty (a northern empire), based on celestial technology, 300 years ago. - The artefact was created by accident, and the scholar went mad.
