**_Highshrine Parasite._** Inside the lich’s torso dwells a digital parasite that contains the lich’s soul. When the lich dies, it implodes into the parasite, which then vanishes into the Far Realm. In 2d4 days, the parasite causes the lich to reappear within 1d4 miles of where it died.

## Background

- Lagfel was once [JohnMcLeod](../../hostile/npcs/JohnMcLeod.md)

Loquiroth, initially known as John McLeod, was once a formidable mage of the ancient world, a figure of immense wisdom and power. His journey into the realms of the unknown began with an insatiable curiosity for the arcane and the hidden truths of the universe. This quest for knowledge led him to the discovery of the Outsiders, enigmatic entities from beyond the known realms, beings of unfathomable power and intelligence.

The Outsiders, alien in nature and origin, possessed knowledge far beyond the comprehension of mortal beings. They were masters of the cosmic energies that wove the fabric of existence, manipulators of the very essence of life and death. Intrigued by Loquiroth's boldness and thirst for knowledge, they chose to impart upon him the secrets of their power. This exchange was not without cost, as the knowledge they offered was so profound and complex that it required Loquiroth to undergo a series of trials that tested the limits of his mind, body, and spirit.

Through these trials, Loquiroth learned to harness the cosmic energies that the Outsiders wielded. He discovered how to manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe, to bend them to his will, and to channel them into his own being. His body and soul became a conduit for these alien energies, transforming him in ways that defied the laws of nature. His physical form began to transmute, taking on aspects of the Outsiders' own draconic visages, until he emerged from his final trial not as a man, but as a Dragon King.

This transformation was not merely physical. Loquiroth's mind expanded, able to comprehend the mysteries of the cosmos in ways that he had never before imagined. His power was potentiated, magnified to a degree that set him apart from all other beings on Earth. He had become a bridge between the world of mortals and the incomprehensible realms of the Outsiders, a being of both earth and the stars.

As a Dragon King, Loquiroth wielded his newfound abilities with wisdom and authority. He became a guardian of the arcane secrets he had learned, protector of the realms that lay at the borders of reality. Yet, his transformation and the power it brought came with a sense of isolation, for there were few who could understand the depths of his knowledge or the origins of his power.

Loquiroth's legacy is a testament to the pursuit of knowledge and the understanding that some secrets come with profound changes. His existence serves as a bridge between the known and the unknown, a reminder of the possibilities that lie beyond the edges of the map, in the realms where the Outsiders dwell.
