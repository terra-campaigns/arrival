### Motivations

- 

## Intro

- Scenes are to be self contained, with no impact on the starting hook. We are just testing a few of the game systems.
- house rules
- watch alien
- campaign is the execution of this contract (5 sessions), from there we decide if we like this or if we leave at this.

## Strong start

- Contract kick-off meeting with [tharsisMining](campaign/hostile/factions/tharsisMining.md) General Manager for Ice Exploration John McLeod. Details of the mission, milestones, payment, starship etc.:
	- Their ship is already in Brightside (starship is modified with lead panels), travel by shuttle
	- Description of the region of NEZ that the crew is going
	- All ore you find is property of Tharsis, and you need to refine it and set for delivery in Brightside. You will be compensated with 10% of its base price.
	- Name the crew?
	- Carry a holographic AI suitcase to speak with the GM weekly on Saturdays.
	- Replacements (in case of sickness or indisposition) will be sent from the fastest system where they can be available.
	- Travel to Perdurabo:
		- Red Giant: Large fast transfer liner Tau Ceti star port: 7 days, then transfer.
		- Red Giant: Transfer liner Tau Ceti - Defiance: 8 days, then transfer.
		- Colonial Endeavours' Novium Transport: Transfer to Brightside: 10 days.

## Potential scenes

- **Combat system**: Boxing bet rig in the starport (organised, no danger of much harm) HD 2 NPC
- **Social skills system**: Bar scene where a computer scientist nerd from [haruna](campaign/hostile/factions/haruna.md) is **locked** in a toilet by a [lebkuchen](campaign/hostile/factions/lebkuchen.md)
	- The nerd is tied, and just un-gagged himself to scream for help
	- A lebkuchen hd01 is 5 toilet booths to the right, and if someone comes to help, the lebkuchen will make a mess to diverge their attention, but run when the timer blips for 20 seconds (either door or window)
