### Katho
***The Kathan Empire***

In the vast desert of Maqqatba lies Katho, an empire built on the ruins of a long-forgotten civilisation. The people of the empire are hardy and resourceful, able to survive in the harsh conditions of the desert through their ingenuity and determination. 

Katho's lands in the sourth have always been coveted by the aberrations and frozen monstrosities of the D'elsinese Empire. The war between the two kingdoms has lasted for centuries, with neither side gaining a clear military advantage. The current rulers of Katho have already committed most of their available armies to the war, and the empire is now anguished. Military alliances have existed for the last ten years. Neighbouring lands such as Foucheresia (to the west), and their fierce dragonborn host, and Romburghia (to the east) have pledged support for Katho.

As the war persist, people of the desert empire have grown weary of the conflict. Some in the north are questioning the motives of their rulers and their willingness to sacrifice so many lives for the sake of power and control. Whispers of rebellion and unrest are growing louder in the capital in the north, Throtha. Meanwhile, the entire northern region has been battling their own problems, including the spree of Lady Scurvy and the [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism) religious takeover.

### Romburgh

Romburghia is a troubled land, rife with tension, secrets and fear. Its people are divided by culture and religion, and its aristocracy is on the brink of collapse. A coastal kingdom, located on the east of Maqqatba, Romburghia is bordered by the Khathan Empire to the west. It is also the only land access of Hincland to the continent, making it a strategically important location. At the heart of Romburghia's power struggles lies a fragmented aristocratic organisation, where no one is sure of their own power. The titular ruler, surrounded by a web of spying and blackmail, is feared by all who cross their path. Meanwhile, the ruler's lover and the court sorcerer hold strong position and influence, using their power to manipulate the court's fragile balance.

The kingdom is a patchwork of cultures, with the north being dominated by the ancient Mercian ways, while the south is a vast expanse of nomadic Nurfirth. However, the original Mercian religion has long been in decline, with most of the country now following either the church of Falet or the gods of the [Yotunn Ancestors](religions.md#Yotunn) pantheon. The [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism) religion has officially been adopted by the kingdom, but it is a decision made out of fear, for the Mercians of Hincland have long been rumored to dabble in black magic. The rulers have turned a blind eye to non-conventional approaches to converting folk religion followers to the official religion of Falet, desperately seeking to expand its reach and hold over the kingdom.

### Nurderad
***Theme: Decadence & Legitimacy (wwn124)***

- **Court: Lance Defenders**
- FFKA is growing in influence in the nation.
- Nurderad has always helped with perils in Maqqatba.
- The war in the south is exhausting Nurderad.
- The pyramid (working) has been activated.

In the heart of the Nurdead Praetorian Nation, the capital city of Djerad Thymar stood as a testament to both grandeur and mystery. Whispers carried on the wind spoke of its renown, spreading tales of awe and trepidation throughout the realms. 

Djerad Thymar, a name that resonated with both reverence and fear, boasted a breathtaking sight that defied mortal imagination. Rising from the earth like a colossal beast of ancient lore, the entire city took the form of a hollow pyramid. Its architecture, a testament to the architects' twisted genius, rendered it virtually impenetrable to all but the most daring of intruders. Built upon a foundation of unyielding granite, the pyramid stood proudly, its towering height reaching a dizzying 1,500 feet (460 meters) into the sky. A sight that evoked a mix of wonder and unease in the hearts of those who dared to gaze upon it. As if nature itself had conspired with the hands of men, a vast number of columns rose in unison, lending unwavering support to the massive structure above.

A wide ramp, the only gateway to this labyrinthine fortress, beckoned the curious to venture into its depths. Guarded by ancient sentinels and encircled by a sparse collection of farms and humble homesteads, the city stood in stark contrast to the sprawling private domains of the opulent clans. These privileged elite, drawn to the power and allure of Djerad Thymar, chose to erect their opulent estates within the decaying remnants of the long-lost Iopothae civilization, their proximity to the city a constant reminder of the shadows that lingered in its wake.

### Oivepia
***Theme: Expansion & Stratification (wwn124)***

- **Court: Faletist Knights of the Arc**
- Suspected of ethnicity cleansing.
- Their culture is widely admired.
- A blighted horde is threatening its borders.
- A horrible monster was driven off.

### Hincland
***Theme: Decadence & Pageantry (wwn124)***

- **Court: Mercians**
- A usurper is being sheltered here.
- Their ruling classes are related to Oivepia's.
- The leadership is inept/distracted.
- A noble heir shows signs of heroic greatness.
- Link with [Mercian](cultures.md#Mercian)

### D'Elsin
***Theme: Barbarism & Stratification (wwn124)***

- **Court: Turnskull Constructs, driving Anak Tribes**
- At war with Katho, Kiranu & Nurderad.
- A hero from Hincland is now in D'Elsin.
- Turnskull has disgorged Made Gods.
- Splendid resources have been reestablished in Turnskull.

#### Anaks
***Source: wwn306***: Sages believe that the original Anakim were a spite-weapon created by the Outsiders when the fall of their hegemony seemed imminent. Captured rebels, still-subject Deeps, and human traitors who were no longer needed were used as the feedstock for the transformation, one intended to create a sentient bioweapon for the destruction of all human and demihuman life in the Latter Earth. Later ages saw the Anakim modified by assorted Imperators, their original nature warped and tuned to serve the purposes of the experimenters. The resulting Anakim sub-species are sometimes drastically different from the ur-Anak, but the intrinsic selfishness, cruelty, and aggression of the base stock persist in most of them.

### Kimbarak
***Theme: Exhaustion & Unity (wwn124)***

- **Courts: Glasrath and Kiranu countries**
- A dwarven working caused problems to the land in the past
- Dwarves in Glasrath were open to receive refugees during the Acrisae arrival
- The Kimbarak people are succumbing
- Glasrah is being restablished

#### Tolfonddundhesm
***Tolfonddund Dwarven Mines***

The southern mine system on the Glasrath Mountains was created by dwarves coming from the town of Tolfoddund, two centuries ago (3671 NC). These dwarves were not as advanced as the Nargun dwarves, but made enough wealth by trading dwarven goods with Watheton (especially Yeswite), which then traded them to other peoples of the Kuzar County and, more broadly, with the Khathan empire.

#### Nargunhesm
***Nargun Dwarven Mines***

The Nargun was a strong Dwarven empire founded in 3217 NC. The King was killed about 15 years ago, in an attack that came from the Ammuinoth, alongside his son and heir. Sitmeak Greybow, was then appointed as regent and has been the regent since - he is in charge. The brother, Whursock Greybow, is the commander of the army.

## Linhe
***Linhe County and Surroundings***

- **Genre**: [dark fantasy](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,dark%20fantasy,0), [folk](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,folk%20horror,0_) and [disaster](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,disaster%20horror,0) horror
- **Hallmarks**: Dwindling resources, fickle hero worship, impending disaster, suspicion, totalitarianism, undead
- **Area:** 87 thousand square miles
- **Population:** Total population of 440 thousand (humans and demi-humans, mostly dust elves and some dwarves)
	- Urban population: 32 thousand
	- 6-mile hex population: 150

The sands of time bury the deserts of Linhe. Here, the wonders of fallen empires and temples of forgotten kings crumble beneath a merciless sun. Untold generations of tombs and secrets lie beneath the sands, markers of a history the land's few residents know of only in story and song. Their interest in past splendor is smothered, as life is harsh in Linhe. Many of Linhe's settlements lie in the middle of old and new ruins, its cities crumbling and unprotected, its villages abandoned and overgrown. Still, bastions of civilisation hold out against the the terrifying dangers of the region.

Linhe is a land besieged. Empty countryside surrounds ruined or crumbling cities. A few desperate pockets of civilisation survive, carrying on not out of hope, but, in most of the region, out of fear of the FFKA's merciless members. Led by [Sergarus](arrival/npcs/Sergarus.md), the paramilitary group organises a desperate and occasionally effective defence against an implacable foe: the ever-growing armies of the dead.

Where the FFKA East is strong, it has turned against the people, making them prisoners within their own country. With cudgel and pike, the soldiers of Falet force every commoner into gruelling labor, rushing them to raise fortifications and scrape ruins from the dirt. Every lash strike, every day of meagre rations is necessary - or so the soldiers claim - because time is short and the undead are coming.

Every few months a new zombie legions issues from the Ghost Domain through caves and cracks in the wastelands. Never emerging from the same place twice, the horde sweeps across the land, drawn to the densest populations of the living. Causalities stack up during the zombie sieges, but miracles and moments of valour have not abandoned Linhe. The people's numbers dwindle, but they soldier on. In the aftermath of an attack, the Linhans burn their dead, repair what they can, and whisper that now might be the time to flee. Invariably, though, someone speaks too loudly and a so-called traitor is impaled upon city walls.

**Noteworthy Features**
- Linhe is a land of vast deserts and rare, but deadly, storms.
- Water is scarce beyond the land's few oases and the cities.
- The monuments, tombs, and pyramids of past golden ages litter Linhe. These countless tombs are interconnected, forming a vast, semi-hidden underground network through the Ammuinoth and the Ghost Domain.
- FFKA soldiers patrol the land, hunting for deserters, looters, and strangers to press into service. Non-compliance is punished with impalement.
- Individuals earn public or military esteem for special acts of heroism. Dubbed "Trueborn of Linhe," these heroes are treated well, but the fickle public turns against them if they're perceived as not doing enough to end the undead invasion.
- Linhans value music, and many locals are accomplished singers or proficient in playing the reed pipe, goblet drum, or arched harp.

All the cities and villages on map (except Gimorkoc, which still follows the [Yotunn Ancestors](religions.md#Yotunn) religion) have been over the decades converting to the northern religion known as [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism). You are also told the northern cities do not speak the same common language as you do. The common language you've been speaking until now on the region is called Cold Nulfirther. In the northern cities they speak a dialect of this language called Sun Nulfirther, and also the official Khathan language. The Dust elves will speak all of these.

## The Deeps
***The Ammuinoth, the Ghost Domain and the Ophaire***

### Ammuinoth

The kingdom of Iopothae was a very advanced kingdom from ancient times. It is said it covered a larger region than the current [The Kathan Empire](realms.md#Katho). One of the features of the kingdom of Iopothae was the creation of the Ammuinoth (starting around year 1000 IT), a subterranean superstructure that traversed the kingdom (SW to NE), following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. Some researchers believe the energy paths are not real, and that the construction, in a leaf shape, was in deference to the old nature gods. In the Ammuinoth tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TsE7MIy.png)

The Ammuinoth was built by an alliance of immortal elves and dwarves for over a thousand years, which was responsible for shaping the races of the drow (dark elves) and the duergar (dark dwarves), as they ventured deeper and deeper over centuries. It is believed that the drow and duergar came into contact with some subterranean evil power, and were corrupted by it. But the corruption went unnoticed, until it was too late. It is not known when exactly, but around two millennia after the construction started the drow came across a god-built cavern system below the Ammuinoth. This was named the Ghost Domain (or the Underdark by the nowadays drows). The duergar did not venture often to the Ghost Domain, as it was too primitive for them.

The Ammuinoth was built as a series of underground tunnels following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. In these tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. Now, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. On the map, in blue are Brezal Paths whose tunnels have collapsed or partially collapsed and in black are tunnels in work order.

Nowadays, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. Even the better tunnels have several fractures, from where the Ghost Domain can be accessed. In every large construction in the Ammuinoth, access to the surface and the ghost domain were built - but some of them are now lost.

**Dwellers of the Ammuinoth**:
- Due to the access from the surface to the Ammuinoth: gangs of bandits and other scourge take lair and hide in the tunnels, in general everyone who wants to hide from society can be found there.
- Due to the frequent connects with the Ghost Domain: most of the creatures from the ghost domain can be found here including fiends, undead, drows, duegar, even beholders!

### Ghost Domain and the Ophaire

The Ghost Domain is grouped in layers: the Upper Domain (also known as Upperdark), the Lower Domain (also known as Middledark) and the Ophaire (also known as the Lowerdark, or the Dark Primitive). In the region where there is the Ammuinoth, it connects the surface to the Upper Domain, but it is also possible to go directly from the Upper Domain to the surface, although in very challenging cavern openings, mostly inaccessible for human sized creatures. As time went by, the drow and duergar grew apart: the duergar living in the Ammuinoth and in the north east area of the Upper Domain, while the drow lived in more deep areas of the Ghost Domain, mostly towards the south.

The Ghost Domain's underground landscape varies from small subterranean fissures almost impossible for adventurers to crawl through, to wide expanses of deep water that hides coral caves, hollowed out sections of ice in which creatures lived, and places where fungus, bones, or even pure force formed caves. This varied landscape is as dynamic as the surface. Some areas are always changing over time because of underground magma rivers or the emptying of underground lakes due to cracks in the rock formed by earthquakes. This meant maps of the Underdark were highly unreliable.

The Upper Domain is about 4 Km deep, and it is inhabited by many dark-loving creatures (not necessarily evil ones). Some drow also live here, and sometimes some duergar too. The Lower Domain, 5 to 15 Km deep, is where the biggest drow cities exist, and drow nobility lives there. These drow are already too disconnected from the world above, and even duergar fear their evilness. Finally, deeper lies the Ophaire. It is not fully known if the dark primitive is still part of the world as a cavern system or if it is already some other type of dimension, as time and space seem to flow differently in such a depth. It is said the dark primitive lies between 20 and 100 Km from the surface, but these are all speculations. The deepest areas of the Ophaire are also known as Deadecho, and in these regions it is said that only true death can exist. It is said that in its depths, the shadow roads in the Ophaire access the Void - a region of madness and emptiness.

The Deadecho, the dominion of [Algath]context/religions.md#Algath) (and the equally notorious Vardesain and Anu-Akma, fellow demigods of the dead), is notable for its silence - an existence of enormous deserts of bones, dunes of dust, and rivers of blood and tears. These are the dry lands, where life extends past its appointed span, where fate itself is thwarted with regularity, and where liches, vampires, and ghouls gather in enormous numbers to praise their patron and the font of vileness, to cheat death, to praise their protection against a certain voyage into the hells and the joy and strength of the god of the undead and his near-infinite legions.

Deadecho, Plane of Undeath (MWB 46) - Evermaw is confused with the Eleven Hells, since it is an afterlife of ghouls and vampires, cannibals and gluttons. A road like a lolling tongue sprawls through a waterless desert of blood dust, passing towers that sprout like crooked white teeth, until it’s swallowed by the gulletlike sinkhole that houses the city of Vulture’s Beyond, osseous capital of the Hunger God Vardesain, as well as the Eternal Palace of the dry undead lord Mot and the Crystal Necropolis of the guardian god Anu-Akma. Here ziggurats flow with the blood of daily sacrifices, liches study new necromancies of flesh and bone, and the cooks claim they can skin and butcher anything, from ghosts to gods.

### Acrisae
***Theme: Renewal & Hope (wwn124)***

- They are forcing back all the region
- They fought with the elves in a long past
- Farmland is worning out
- A powerful artefact is helping the ruler

***The Void's Hood of Telepathy, requires attunement***

Unknown origin.

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the **[detect thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts)** spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using a bonus action to do so--while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with **[detect thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-thoughts)**, you can use an action to cast the **[suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion)** spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the **[suggestion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/suggestion)** property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Cloak of Bitter Luck
***Mercian cloak, requires attunement***

Its textile was etched with ancient runes that glowed when activated with a pulsing, ethereal energy. The cloak had been woven by a long-dead wizard, who had imbued it with the power to harness the luck through air itself. It was said that the wizard had met a terrible fate, his body withered away from overuse of the cloak' power. But despite the risks, many still sought out the cloak, eager to wield its incredible power and claim their place among the greatest mages in the land. The cloak is full of runes written in Qualith.

- You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.
- Any friendly creature within 60ft of the cloak can expend one sanity point to re-roll any dice that directly impacts oneself.

## Congealed Paradox
***Northern origin, required attunement***

These thumb-sized black gemstones are mildly painful to touch or look at, as each one contains an impossible duality that has been forcibly reconciled by ancient sorcery. When gripped and broken as a Main Action, the released paradox draws the immediate repression of the Legacy as mundane reality is violently reinforced in the surrounding 20 feet. Within that radius all active magic or psionic powers are immediately dispelled and no further power use can be performed inside it for the rest of the scene. Only celestial powers are immune to the paradox. Creatures reliant on magic or psionics for existence take 5d6 damage for each full round they spend inside this radius. Every usage requires a sanity check for those who observe the effects, 1d6 sanity cost if fail.

**History**
- Widely known item, Arcane check DC 8/15.
- Created by a mad scholar from the Fifth Dynasty (a northern empire), based on celestial technology, 300 years ago.
- The artefact was created by accident, and the scholar went mad.
